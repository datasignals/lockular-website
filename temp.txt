                                        This use case is currently being developed in collaboration with a partner who approached Lockular with the concept. The partner will have exclusive rights to sell the solution
                                        on a global scale, with support from Lockular.

                                        Lockular's Provenance suite is being tailored to address the stringent requirements of the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) in the pharmaceutical industry.
                                        Fundamentally this means the creation of a domain specific contract that drives the behaviour of Lockular's Smart Contract Actor Management system. Data is not stored on chain
                                        but inside of Lockular's Provenance tracking filesystem.

                                        This use case leverages key components from the Lockular Supply Chain Provenance suite to ensure compliance with the FMD's delegated regulation, which mandates the
                                        verification of medicinal products' authenticity through a decommissioning process. This process involves scanning a unique 2D barcode assigned to every manufactured medicinal
                                        product pack at various levels: the individual item, a package of items, and a pallet of packages.

                                         <span class="content-body-highlight"> Workflow: </span>
                                        The typical workflow starts with the manufacture of the medicinal products, where each unit is assigned a unique 2D barcode. These units are then packaged and
                                        palletised for distribution. The workflow progresses as follows:
                                        <ol type="1">
                                        <li> 1. Manufacture: Medicinal products are manufactured and each unit is assigned a unique 2D barcode. Units are then packaged into larger groups and palletized.     </li> <br>
                                        <li> 2. Shipping to Wholesaler: The pallets are shipped to wholesalers, where the integrity and authenticity of the barcodes are verified and logged via the Supply Chain Proveannce solution. </li> <br>
                                        <li> 3. Wholesaler to Customer: Wholesalers distribute the pallets or break them down into smaller packages to ship to customers, typically hospitals. </li> <br>
                                        <li> 4. Hospital to Patient: Within the hospital, medical practitioners issue the medicinal products to patients. Each issued unit's barcode is scanned to verify its authenticity. </li> <br>
                                        <li> 5. Decommissioning: Once a medicinal product is issued to a patient, its barcode is decommissioned, marking it as used in the system to prevent reuse or falsification. </li> <br>
                                        </ol>
                                        </p>

                                        Supply Chain Tracking and Compliance:
                                        </span>
                                        Throughout the supply chain, the assembly of packages and pallets is meticulously tracked at the manufacturing stage. As pallets are shipped and subsequently broken down by wholesalers,
                                        each step is recorded. This tracking continues until the final delivery to the patient. Lockular's Provenance Tracking system plays a crucial role in this process:
                                        <ol  type="1">
                                            <li> 1. Provenance Tracking and Security: The entire journey of each medicinal product, from manufacturing to patient delivery, is continuously monitored and recorded on a
                                            dedicated blockchain system via Lockular's Provenance Tracking filesystem. This ensures an immutable record of all transactions, changes, and decommissioning actions,
                                            significantly enhancing the security, traceability, and compliance of the distribution process. 
                                            </li> <br>

                                            <li> 2. Integration with Regulatory Requirements: The system is designed to comply with the FMD regulations by ensuring that all medicinal products can be authenticated
                                            and decommissioned according to legal requirements. This helps prevent the distribution of falsified medicines and ensures patient safety.

                                        The implementation of Lockular's Provenance suite will provides a secure, transparent, and compliant environment for the manufacturing and distribution of medicinal products.
                                        This not only enhances the security and integrity of the medicinal supply chain but also ensures full compliance with the FMD regulations, leading to increased trust and
                                        safety in pharmaceutical distribution.

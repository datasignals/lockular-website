                                        <p>Provenance suite has been successfully implemented in the specialised area of Silicon Chip Design and Manufacturing, specifically customised for Codasip, a leader in tailored RISC-V design tools. This scenario utilises three main components from the Lockular Supply Chain Provenance suite: SecureWorking, Supply Chain Actor Management (SCA), and the NFT Marketplace platform.</p>
                                        
                                        <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> Supply Chain Actor Management (SCA):</span>
                                        SCA is critical in shaping and overseeing the cooperative relationships among organisations involved in the chip design and manufacturing processes. Using Smart contract technology, SCA sets strict protocols that dictate how these organisations interact, collaborate, and exchange design information. This organised approach ensures a high level of precision and compliance throughout the collaborative efforts.</p>
                                        
                                        <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> SecureWorking: </span>
                                        SecureWorking is used to offer chip designers a cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) powered by Microsoft Visual Studio Code, specifically tailored for Codasip's chip design toolchain. The cloud setup is securely isolated, supported by the Lockular Provenance Tracking filesystem, which ensures comprehensive tracking and security of all activities and design data within the environment. Access to this platform is tightly controlled by Codasip-specific smart contracts managed by SCA, ensuring that only authorised personnel can access the critical design tools and data and in turn all activity recorded.</p>
                                        
                                        <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> Provenance Tracking and Security:</span>
                                        Every aspect of the designs produced within SecureWorking is continuously monitored and documented on a dedicated Polkadot parachain (blockchain) by Lockular's Provenance Tracking filesystem. This blockchain-based monitoring system provides a permanent record of all design actions, modifications, and accesses, significantly enhancing the security and traceability of the design process. This detailed monitoring is essential for protecting intellectual property and maintaining the integrity of the design process in the highly competitive and secretive chip design sector. Provenance records and reports are a significant component in fulfilling the requirement of the US ITAR standard used across the defense sector.</p>
                                        
                                        <p></p><span class="content-body-highlight"> Integration with NFT Marketplace: </span>
                                        The NFT Marketplace is utilised to tokenise design prototypes or intellectual property, facilitating secure and verifiable transactions within the design ecosystem. For Codasip, this enables the sharing of common chip IP block definitions among teams within the partner network. IP Blocks form the basis of a larger single chip design.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><span class="content-body-highlight">Benefit:</span>
                                        The deployment of Lockular's Provenance suite has equipped Codasip with a secure, transparent, and efficient environment for  their chip design tooling.

                                         <span class="content-body-highlight"> Workflow: </span>
                                        The typical workflow starts with the manufacture of the medicinal products, where each unit is assigned a unique 2D barcode. These units are then packaged and
                                        palletised for distribution. The workflow progresses as follows:
                                        <ol type="1">
                                        <li> 1. Manufacture: Medicinal products are manufactured and each unit is assigned a unique 2D barcode. Units are then packaged into larger groups and palletized.     </li> <br>
                                        <li> 2. Shipping to Wholesaler: The pallets are shipped to wholesalers, where the integrity and authenticity of the barcodes are verified and logged via the Supply Chain Proveannce solution. </li> <br>
                                        <li> 3. Wholesaler to Customer: Wholesalers distribute the pallets or break them down into smaller packages to ship to customers, typically hospitals. </li> <br>
                                        <li> 4. Hospital to Patient: Within the hospital, medical practitioners issue the medicinal products to patients. Each issued unit's barcode is scanned to verify its authenticity. </li> <br>
                                        <li> 5. Decommissioning: Once a medicinal product is issued to a patient, its barcode is decommissioned, marking it as used in the system to prevent reuse or falsification. </li> <br>
                                        </ol>
                                        </p>

                                        Supply Chain Tracking and Compliance:
                                        </span>
                                        Throughout the supply chain, the assembly of packages and pallets is meticulously tracked at the manufacturing stage. As pallets are shipped and subsequently broken down by wholesalers,
                                        each step is recorded. This tracking continues until the final delivery to the patient. Lockular's Provenance Tracking system plays a crucial role in this process:
                                        <ol  type="1">
                                            <li> 1. Provenance Tracking and Security: The entire journey of each medicinal product, from manufacturing to patient delivery, is continuously monitored and recorded on a
                                            dedicated blockchain system via Lockular's Provenance Tracking filesystem. This ensures an immutable record of all transactions, changes, and decommissioning actions,
                                            significantly enhancing the security, traceability, and compliance of the distribution process. 
                                            </li> <br>

                                            <li> 2. Integration with Regulatory Requirements: The system is designed to comply with the FMD regulations by ensuring that all medicinal products can be authenticated
                                            and decommissioned according to legal requirements. This helps prevent the distribution of falsified medicines and ensures patient safety.

                                        The implementation of Lockular's Provenance suite will provides a secure, transparent, and compliant environment for the manufacturing and distribution of medicinal products.
                                        This not only enhances the security and integrity of the medicinal supply chain but also ensures full compliance with the FMD regulations, leading to increased trust and
                                        safety in pharmaceutical distribution.

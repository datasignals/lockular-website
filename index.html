                                        <p> Lockular's Provenance suite has been effectively deployed in the niche sector of Silicon Chip Design and Manufacturing, tailored specifically for Codasip, a pioneer in customized RISC-V design tools. This implementation incorporates three primary components from the Lockular Supply Chain Provenance suite: SecureWorking, Workflow Actor Management (WAM), and the NFT Marketplace platform. This integration guarantees unalterable traceability (provenance) of three essential elements of the design process: the foundational chip designs, the utilisation of design outputs (such as SDK's), and the evolving configuration of teams working together on a design. </p>
                                        
                                        <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> Workflow Actor Management (WAM): </span>
                                            WAM is critical in shaping and overseeing the cooperative relationships among organisations involved in the chip design and manufacturing processes. Using Smart contract technology, WAM sets strict protocols that dictate how these organisations interact, collaborate, and exchange design information. This organised approach ensures a high level of precision and compliance throughout the collaborative efforts. WAM ensures provenance records pertaining to the structure of the collaborative teams are tracked and maintained at all times ensuring full historic knowledge of those involved in a chip or part chip design. </p>                                        
                                        <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> SecureWorking: </span>
                                            SecureWorking is used to offer chip designers a cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) powered by Microsoft Visual Studio Code, specifically tailored for Codasip's chip design toolchain. The cloud setup is securely isolated, supported by the Lockular Provenance Tracking filesystem, which ensures comprehensive tracking and security of all activities and design data within the environment. Access to this platform is tightly controlled by Codasip-specific smart contracts managed by WAM, ensuring that only authorised personnel can access and contribute to designs, and ensuring team structure is immutable tracked and recorded over time.</p>
                                        
                                        <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> Provenance Tracking and Security: </span>
                                            Every aspect of the designs produced within the SecureWorking IDE are continuously monitored and documented on a dedicated Polkadot parachain (blockchain) by Lockular's Provenance Tracking filesystem. This blockchain-based monitoring system provides a permanent record of all design actions, modifications, and accesses, significantly enhancing the security and traceability of the design process. This detailed monitoring is essential for protecting intellectual property and maintaining the integrity of the design process in the highly competitive and secretive chip design sector. Provenance records and reports are a significant component in fulfilling the requirement of the US ITAR standard used across the US defense sector.</p>
                                        
                                        <p></p><span class="content-body-highlight"> Integration with NFT Marketplace: </span>
                                            The NFT Marketplace is utilised to tokenise design outputs or intellectual property. Design outputs often take the form of part designs known as IP Blocks. The NFT marketplace facilitates rigours controlled design sharing with immutable provenance tracking of the shared objects. In Codasip's case, this enables the sharing of common chip IP block definitions amongst teams within the partner network controlled by WAM based smart contracts. IP Blocks form the basis of a larger single chip designs.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><span class="content-body-highlight">Benefit:</span>
                                            The implementation of Lockular's Provenance suite has enabled Codasip to effortlessly integrate its chip design tool chain with SecureWorking, instantly providing a secure, cloud-based design environment complete with comprehensive provenance tracking benefits. This integration has not only strengthened the security and integrity of the design process but also improved collaboration and compliance, resulting in increased productivity and innovation within Codasip's chip design platform. Codasip has branded this integration as Secure Studio in the Cloud (SSitC) and is working with Lockular to promote the Provenance Supply Chain for RISC-V design services.</p>

                                            This use case is currently being developed in collaboration with a partner who approached Lockular with the concept. The partner will have exclusive rights to sell the solution on a global scale, with support from Lockular.

                                            Lockular's Provenance suite is being tailored to address weaknesses in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Fundamentally this means the creation of a domain specific contract that drives the behaviour of Lockular's Smart Contract Actor Management system. Data is not stored on chain but inside of Lockular's Provenance tracking filesystem with metadata being linked to the unique auditable transactions afforded by the smart-contracts the platform creates.

                                         Throughout the supply chain, the assembly of packages and pallets is meticulously tracked at each stage. Each transaction in the product lifecycle is tracked ‘on-chain’ in an immutable record. This tracking continues until the final delivery to the patient.

                                        The implementation of Lockular's Provenance suite will provide a secure, transparent, and compliant environment for the manufacturing and distribution of medicinal products. This not only enhances the security and integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain, leading to increased trust and safety in pharmaceutical distribution.

                                        an NFT to create a provenance record. </li> <br>
                                        <li> 2. Initial Purchase: Upon purchase, the NFT is transferred to the buyer, updating the ownership in the provenance record. </li> <br>

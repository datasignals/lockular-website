                                        <p> Lockular's Provenance suite has been effectively deployed in the niche sector of Silicon Chip Design for Codasip, a pioneer in customised RISC-V design tools.
                                            This implementation incorporates four primary components from the Lockular Provenance suite: Provenance Tracking Filesystem, Workflow Actor Management, Theia.Cloud, and the NFT Marketplace platform.
                                            This integration guarantees unalterable traceability (provenance) of three essential elements of the design process: the foundational chip designs, the utilisation of design outputs (such as SDK's), and the evolving configuration of teams working together on a design. </p>
                                        
                                            <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> Provenance Tracking Filesystem</span>
                                                Every aspect of the designs produced within the Theia.Cloud IDE are continuously monitored and documented on a dedicated blockchain by Lockular's Provenance Tracking filesystem.
                                                This blockchain-based monitoring system provides a permanent record of all design actions, modifications, and accesses, significantly enhancing the security and traceability of the design process.
                                                This detailed monitoring is essential for protecting intellectual property and maintaining the integrity of the design process in the highly competitive and secretive chip design sector.
                                                Provenance records and reports are a significant component in fulfilling the requirement of the US ITAR standard used across the US defense sector.</p>
    
                                            <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> Workflow Actor Management</span>
                                            is critical in shaping and overseeing the cooperative relationships among organisations involved in the chip design and manufacturing processes. Using Smart contract technology, WAM sets strict protocols that dictate how these organisations interact,
                                            collaborate, and exchange design information. This organised approach ensures a high level of precision and compliance throughout the collaborative efforts. WAM ensures provenance records pertaining to the structure of the collaborative teams are tracked and
                                            maintained at all times ensuring full historic knowledge of those involved in a chip or part chip design. </p>                                        
                                        
                                        <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> Theia.Cloud</span>
                                            is used to offer chip designers a cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) powered by Microsoft Visual Studio Code, dynamically loaded with Codasip's chip design toolchain.
                                            The cloud setup is securely isolated, supported by the Lockular Provenance Tracking filesystem, which ensures comprehensive tracking and security of all activities and design data within the environment.
                                            Access to this platform is tightly controlled by WAM based smart contracts that reflect Codasip's design team configuration, ensuring that only authorised personnel can access and contribute to designs,
                                            and ensuring team structure is immutable tracked and recorded over time.</p>
                                                                                
                                        <p><span class="content-body-highlight">NFT Marketplace</span>
                                            is utilised to mint design outputs or intellectual property. Design outputs often take the form of part designs known as IP Blocks. The NFT marketplace facilitates rigourous controlled design sharing with immutable provenance tracking of the shared objects.
                                            In Codasip's case, this enables the sharing of common chip IP block definitions amongst teams within the partner network controlled by WAM based smart contracts. IP Blocks form the basis of a larger single chip designs.</p>
                                        
                                        <p><span class="content-body-highlight">Benefits</span>
                                            The implementation of Lockular's Provenance suite has enabled Codasip to effortlessly integrate its chip design tool chain with a cloud based IDE containing core Lockular components,
                                            instantly providing a secure, cloud-based design environment complete with comprehensive provenance tracking. This integration has not only strengthened the security and integrity of the design process but also improved collaboration and compliance,

                                            Lockular's Provenance suite has been expertly customised for the specialised area of Material Design, specifically for a prominent US Metals and Alloys Company. This use case integrates essential elements from the Lockular Provenance suite:
                                            Provenance Tracking Filesystem, Workflow Actor Management (WAM), and Theia.Cloud, focusing on the design, specification, and estimation of metals and alloys. Looking ahead, it is anticipated that a network of suppliers and customers will
                                            develop around an NFT Marketplace, where individual sheets of material are tracked as NFTs.</p>

                                        <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> Provenance Tracking Filesystem</span> 
                                                All design activities within Theia.Cloud, including the detailed specifications of metals and alloys and their processing methods, are consistently monitored and logged on a dedicated blockchain through the use of Lockular's Provenance Tracking filesystem.
                                                This blockchain-based system maintains an unalterable record of all design activities, modifications, and access, greatly enhancing the security and traceability of the material design process.
                                                This high level of detailed tracking is vital for safeguarding intellectual property and maintaining the integrity of the design process in the competitive field of material design.
                                                Provenance records and reporting are crucial for upholding industry standards and compliance. </p>    
                                        
                                        <p> <span class="content-body-highlight"> Workflow Actor Management</span>
                                            Within the realm of material design, WAM is crucial for orchestrating and defining the interactions among various stakeholders involved in the design and specification of metals and alloys.
                                            By employing smart contract technology, WAM imposes strict protocols that dictate how these parties collaborate and exchange vital information on material composition and estimates.
                                            This methodical approach guarantees stringent compliance and accuracy throughout the design process. ITAR and CMMC are important here as many of the requirements come from the US defense and spaces industries. </p>
                                        
                                        <p>  <span class="content-body-highlight">Theia.Cloud</span>
                                            Theia.Cloud offers designers a cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) containing the client's own specialised design tools. This includes a proprietary estimator tool that works with CAD input
                                            drawings to determine material requirements and enhance cutting strategies. The cloud environment is securely isolated and supported by the Lockular Provenance Tracking filesystem, ensuring comprehensive
                                            tracking and security of all activities and data within the environment. Access is tightly controlled by company-specific smart contracts overseen by WAM, ensuring that only authorised personnel can access these essential tools and data. </p>

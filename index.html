                                                ensures every aspect of the designs produced within the Theia.Cloud IDE are continuously monitored and documented on a dedicated blockchain by Lockular's Provenance Tracking filesystem.
                                                This blockchain-based monitoring system provides a permanent record of all design actions, modifications, and accesses, significantly enhancing the security and traceability of the design process.
                                                This detailed monitoring is essential for protecting intellectual property and maintaining the integrity of the design process in the highly competitive and secretive chip design sector.
                                                Provenance records and reports are a significant component in fulfilling the requirement of the US ITAR standard used across the US defense sector.</p>

                                            is critical in shaping and overseeing the cooperative relationships among organisations involved in the chip design and manufacturing processes. Using Smart contract technology, WAM sets strict protocols that dictate how these organisations interact,
                                            collaborate, and exchange design information. This organised approach ensures a high level of precision and compliance throughout the collaborative efforts. WAM ensures provenance records pertaining to the structure of the collaborative teams are tracked and
                                            maintained at all times ensuring full historic knowledge of those involved in a chip or part chip design. </p>

                                            is used to offer chip designers a cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) powered by Microsoft Visual Studio Code, <em>dynamically loaded with Codasip's chip design toolchain and their bespoke vscode extensions</em>.
                                            The cloud setup is securely isolated, supported by the Lockular Provenance Tracking Filesystem, which ensures comprehensive tracking and security of all activities and design data within the environment.
                                            Access to this platform is tightly controlled by WAM based smart contracts that reflect Codasip's design team configuration, ensuring that only authorised personnel can access and contribute to designs,
                                            and ensuring team structure is immutably tracked and recorded over time.</p>

                                            is utilised to mint design outputs or intellectual property. Design outputs often take the form of part designs known as IP Blocks. The NFT marketplace facilitates rigorously controlled design sharing with immutable provenance tracking of the shared objects.
                                            In Codasip's case, this enables the sharing of common chip IP block definitions amongst teams within the partner network controlled by WAM based smart contracts. IP Blocks form the basis of a larger single chip design.</p>

                                            The integration of Lockular's Provenance suite with Codasip's chip design tool chain has seamlessly provided a secure, cloud-based IDE that enhances the security and integrity of the design process. This has fostered improved collaboration and compliance, leading to greater productivity and innovation afforded by Codasip's chip design capability. Codasip has named this integration Secure Studio in the Cloud (SSitC) and is collaborating with Lockular to advance Provenance Supply Chain for RISC-V design services.</p>

                                    is it Real or Fake?</p>

                                        <p>The solution begins at the manufacturing stage where each the fabric that is used in the product (e.g. handbag) is treated with SmartWater,
                                            a unique identifier that marks the material of the handbag with a DNA like marker, albeit more robust than DNA. This identifier is linked to an NFT, establishing the handbag's initial
                                            provenance record. Here's the outline of the supply chain flow:

                                        <ol>
                                        <li> 1. Manufacture: Each handbag is sprayed with SmartWater at the point of manufacture, providing a unique identifier that is associated with
                                        an NFT to create a provenance record. </li> <br>
                                        <li> 2. Initial Purchase: Upon purchase, the NFT is transferred to the buyer, updating the ownership in the provenance record. </li> <br>
                                        <li> 3. Resale Process: </li> <br>

                                        <p> For legacy handbags [pre-SmartWater] the app allows handbags to be sent in for service and the authenticity assessed with the option of retrospective SmartWater based provenance registration.

                                        The mobile app serves as a platform for transactions, where users can buy, sell, or request restoration of handbags. It integrates a Polkadot.js wallet, enabling seamless
                                        transfers of the NFT associated with each handbag. This ensures that every transaction is recorded and the handbag's provenance is maintained and accessible.

                                        This use case leverages Lockular's Provenance suite to provide a secure, transparent, and reliable system for tracking the lifecycle of luxury handbags. By ensuring
                                        the authenticity and condition of each handbag through a detailed provenance record, the system not only enhances consumer trust but also supports the luxury
                                        market in maintaining the value and integrity of high-end products.
